This is an experimental microblog of [Sridhar Ratnakumar](https://www.srid.ca/). It is powered by [Neuron Zettelkasten](https://neuron.zettel.page/).

Purpose:

- **Asocial**[^asocial] microblogging
- Retain **control** of content by oneself
- Allow a semblance of "still in progress". i.e.: [[In the forefront of my mind]].

To figure out how to achieve:

- Interaction and commenting
  - Good ol' email should work right now, but can we do better? Perhaps [piggyback on GitHub issues](https://utteranc.es/).

[^asocial]: Less [hivemind contagion](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788) of popular social networks.
