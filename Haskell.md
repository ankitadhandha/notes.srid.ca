[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an advanced, purely functional programming language. I use Haskell because of its correctness guarantees that are difficult or impossible to achieve with mainstream programming languages.

I use the language to write fullstack web applications, which is to say that even frontend code is written in Haskell (compiled to JavaScript via GHCJS); I highly recommend [[Reflex-FRP]] for writing full-stack web apps in Haskell.

[On GitHub](https://github.com/srid) you can find a list of Haskell projects I work on, the notable of which is [[Neuron]].
