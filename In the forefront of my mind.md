What's been occupying my mind lately:

:::{.ui .large .basic .segment}
- **Explore F\#** for full-stack web development[^reflex] (see [ongoing learning map](https://srid.github.io/learning-fsharp/))
	- [Feather project](https://github.com/srid/Feather)
- **Entrepreneurial efforts** focused on helping small local businesses in Quebec City.
- Rememorate and restore a [**peak experience**](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/library/topics/pce.) I had back in 2008.

:::{.ui .small .basic .segment}
In semi- back burner, but to be picked up soon'ish[^24h]:

- [[Neuron]] **2.0 release**
	- We could use more volunteeers in Neuron. Contact me if you need mentorship help with [[Haskell]] in the context of contributing to Neuron; I'd be happy to help!
- Take **client work** on domains I already specialize on ([[Obelisk]], [[Reflex-FRP]]). Contact me directly (or through [Monadfix](https://monadfix.com/) if you prefer a consultant group) if you have a project in mind.
	- I'm also open to greenfield or still-in-early-phase projects in F#.

[^reflex]: I've been using the [[Haskell]] library/framework [[Reflex-FRP]] for the past few years for developing full-stack & frontend apps in Haskell (eg: [[Cerveau, a future-proof web app for notes]]). The JavaScript transpilation story in Haskell however is not as rapidly and diversely spearheaded as I'd like. Also, I wished to find out what .NET (and more generally Microsoft's open source arm) had to offer that the Haskell ecosystem doesn't, in regards to both this domain and language ecosystem in general. F# is not as *purely* functional as Haskell, however it offers worthy trade-offs in the context of this exploration. I now will have two excellent FP languages in my toolkit; F# & Haskell, each with their own strengths.
