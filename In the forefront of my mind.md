What's been occupying my mind lately:

:::{.sridca-popout .rounded .shadow-2xl .border-2 .border-solid .border-pink-400 .text-xl .mb-4}
- **Explore [[Rust]]** for full-stack web development[^fsharp]
- Increasingly favour open-source / decentralized apps; see [[Apps I use]]
- **Entrepreneurial efforts** focused on helping small local businesses in Quebec City.
- Rememorate and restore a [**peak experience**](http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/library/topics/pce.htm) I had back in 2008.
:::

:::{.text-sm .text-gray-600}
In semi- back burner, but to be picked up soon'ish[^24h]:

- [[Neuron]] **2.0 release**
	- We could use more volunteeers in Neuron. Contact me if you need mentorship help with [[Haskell]] in the context of contributing to Neuron; I'd be happy to help!
- Take **client work** on domains I already specialize on ([[Obelisk]], [[Reflex-FRP]]). Contact me directly (or through [Monadfix](https://monadfix.com/) if you prefer a consultant group) if you have a project in mind.
	- I'm also open to greenfield or still-in-early-phase projects in F#.

[^fsharp]: See [[A brief FSharp exploration]] for a similar exploration but on F\#.

[^24h]: Don't you wish days had more than 24 hours?
