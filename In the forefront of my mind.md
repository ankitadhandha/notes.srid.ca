These are higher topics I've been mulling over lately, and the definite answers regarding them are yet to come up.

- There is typically ==a sense of rush== inherent to **[Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology))** experiences, and it is often overlooked.

  - How to arrive at an answer: experientially find out, in real-time.
