These are higher topics I've been mulling over lately, and the definite answers regarding them are yet to come up.

- Switch more and more to decentralized / open source apps (see [[Apps I use]]).
- Explore F# for full-stack web development, and compare to Haskell's [[Reflex-FRP]] (see [my WIP learning map](https://srid.github.io/learning-fsharp/))
- Entrepreneurial efforts focused on helping small local businesses.
