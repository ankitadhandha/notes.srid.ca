# Srid‚Äôs microblog üêú

A [microblog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging) for smaller updates.

## Recent microposts

## About 

This is my experimental microblog. It is powered by [[Neuron]].

Purpose:
- Steer clear of the [hivemind contagion](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788)[^swamp] of the widely popular social networks.
- Retain **control** of content by oneself
- Allow a semblance of "still in progress" notes. eg.: [[In the forefront of my mind]]#.

To figure out how to achieve:
- Commenting
  - Good ol' email should work right now, but can we do better? Perhaps [piggyback on GitHub issues](https://utteranc.es/).
