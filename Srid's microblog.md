## About 

This is my experimental microblog. It is powered by [[Neuron]].

Purpose:
- **Asocial** microblogging
    - Little to no [hivemind contagion](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788) of popular social networks.
- Retain **control** of content by oneself
- Allow a semblance of "still in progress". i.e.: [[In the forefront of my mind]]#.

To figure out how to achieve:
- Interaction and commenting
- Good ol' email should work right now, but can we do better? Perhaps [piggyback on GitHub issues](https://utteranc.es/).
